As my readers surely noticed, in the past 10 months I run a micro blog consisting of a subset of my Twitter updates.

I found the experiment interesting, and it's amazing how much information you can put in 140 characters. At the same time I find it a bit limiting, for the following reasons:

# I can't use twitter for 'real' twitter updates, as it pollutes the blog
# I couldn't find a straightforward way to filter replies
# I'd love to write some more, some times
# The blog doesn't get indexed correctly, as the twitter integration is done via Javascript

That's why I'm switching back to a normal blog. There are a bunch of things I'll post about in the forthcoming weeks:

* My entrepreneurial experiments
* My career development
* The life of "the Italian guy", in London

Hope you enjoy the change and keep the conversation open with your comments!
