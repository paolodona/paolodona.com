I wanted to report a great video I discovered trough "www.presentationzen.com":http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/08/inbox-zero.html. I hearthly share its content so... keep reading!

I have a bad relationship with email. It's not that I don't like them but I think that checking the inbox too often is a compulsive action, not a necessity.
I hate those email clients which notify me when a new mail arrives. It's distracting... it's totally unproductive... I mean, the power of the email is that you can receive messages while offline or busy and you can read them when you want to. 
Whenever I find myself repeatedly checking my inbox I feel like a dog waiting for a cookie. And even when people are not compulsively checking their inboxes... they're probably scanning their past messages in order to organize their days.
Scanning messages over and over again. Not a good practice if you want to get things done. 
Checking emails every couple of hours is more than enough.

Are email clients becoming our new to-do lists? Should we spend so much time on our email inbox? Should our lives be email driven?

On this subject "Merlin Mann":http://www.merlinmann.com gave us a "great presentation":http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=973149761529535925&hl=en inlined here:

Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
