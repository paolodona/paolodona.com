title: A bunch of new books 
author: Paolo Dona
---
Given I've chosen to have no TV set at home, I've been doing a lot of reading lately. I finished a couple of great inspirational books that I really suggest you to read:

# "4 hour work week":http://tinyurl.com/ll4d6d (the best book I've read in years!)
# "The magic of thinking big":http://tinyurl.com/mer744 (and why being a positive person is actually a good thing)

And here a bunch more I just ordered on Amazon:

# "The E-myth revisited":http://tinyurl.com/n8uft5
# "The 22 Immutable laws of marketing":http://tinyurl.com/mje8kr
# "The 80/20 Principle: The Secret of Achieving More with Less":http://tinyurl.com/n3xbkl
# "Letters from a Stoic: Epistulae Morales AD Lucilium":http://tinyurl.com/ney5hz

These should fill my free time in the next weeks. 
I love inspirational books, and enterpreneurship-oriented ones.

Have you guys got any ideas for my next order? Anything interesting you've recently read?
